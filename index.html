     Established in 1970, the Linda Farrow brand of luxury eyewear rose quickly to acclaim. Originally a fashion designer herself, Linda Farrow was one of the first to treat sunglasses as fashion, her finger always on the pulse of the times. A tireless experimenter, Farrow pioneered many of the shapes and styles that remain au courant today. Her pioneering use of shape helped move eyewear into high-fashion territory, with avant-garde styles favoured by stars like Yoko Ono and working with brands such as Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Sonia Rykiel.

After a twenty year hiatus, the brand was revived in 2003 by Farrow’s son Simon following the discovery of a vast archive of vintage sunglasses in the family’s London warehouse. The brand relaunched under a new title ‘Linda Farrow Vintage’.

Today, operating under the original Linda Farrow name, the brand is renowned for collaborating with some of the world’s most acclaimed designers – Dries van Noten, Phillip Lim, Jeremy Scott amongst many others, constantly bringing a new perspective to the brand. Combined with the unprecedented archive of vintage sunglasses and uncompromisingly luxurious Fine Jewellery collection, the brand has established itself as one of the most exciting in fashion.
